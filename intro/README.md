Intro to Typescript
===================
This first part we will setup typescript for development.
1. First, assuming you have already installed node.js, now install typescript globally.
 ```
    npm install -g typescript
 ```
2. Now just compile the main.ts file that is in this "intro" folder. The --watch option is just to allow it to watch and listen for changes in main.ts and compile it into the main.js
```
    tsc --watch
```
We will be using this intro part to explain some basic functionalities and features of typescript and explain a little bit about how it works.
